This POC combines data coming from the St Louis FED and YFinance.

The data from the St. Louis FED is to get the 1 year treasury yield.

YFinance is a free source to get closing prices for stocks.

Both these data points are needed in order to get the risk free rate for the beginning period and the daily returns to show volatility
